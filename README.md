## Abstract

Modern software development processes today are often conducted via Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for every iterative code change. These build, test, deploy, and monitor each committed code changes from a code repository and help reduce human intervention in the process from development to deployment. This leaves these CI/CD-machines at a critical point the software development and deployment process and a failure of the integrity of these machines could lead to safety or security issues of the produced software. With this work we will show how to use Trusted computing technologies in the form of remote attestation to mitigate this issue by enforcing a system state and policies on the CI/CD-machine and providing a proof of the enforcement of it with the deployed software. This also helps to reduce human intervention needed for having a trustworthy binary.
