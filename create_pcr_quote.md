### Create a trusted public key to perform PCR quote

To create a trusted public key for the purpose of performing a PCR (Platform Configuration Register) quote, you need to first create the key using a public key cryptography algorithm such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Then, the public key must be loaded into the TPM2 chip as a trusted key.

Here's an example of how to create a trusted RSA public key using OpenSSL:

```yaml

# Generate a private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem

# Extract the public key from the private key
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# Load the public key into the TPM2 chip
tpm2_load -c context.bin -u public.pem -r key.rsa -n key.name -f pem

# Make the key a trusted key
tpm2_evictcontrol -C o -c context.bin -S 0x01000000 -P owner -a key.name


```

In this example, the openssl genpkey command is used to generate a private RSA key and store it in a file named private.pem. The openssl rsa command is then used to extract the public key from the private key and store it in a file named public.pem. The tpm2_load command is used to load the public key into the TPM2 chip and store it in a file named key.rsa. Finally, the tpm2_evictcontrol command is used to make the key a trusted key.

It's important to keep the private key secure, as it is used to sign digital signatures and decrypt encrypted messages. The public key, on the other hand, can be used to validate the digital signatures created by the TPM2.

Please consult the tpm2-tools documentation for more information on creating and using a trusted public key for the purpose of performing a PCR quote.


###  Create a PCR quote using trusted public key

Creating a PCR (Platform Configuration Register) quote using a trusted public key requires several steps:

Read the PCR values: Use the TPM2 tools to read the current values of the PCRs into a file.

Create a quote of the PCR values: Use the TPM2 tools to create a quote of the PCR values using a saved TPM2 context and the PCR values file. The quote will be a digital signature created by the TPM2.

Validate the quote: Use the trusted public key to validate the digital signature contained in the quote. This will verify that the quote was created by a trusted TPM2 and that the platform has not been tampered with.

Here is an example of how to create a PCR quote using a trusted public key:

```yaml
# Read the values of the PCRs into a file
tpm2_pcrread -g 0 > pcr_values.bin

# Create a quote of the PCR values
tpm2_quote -c context.bin -g 0x000b -l sha256:0,1,2,3 -o quote.bin -m pcr_values.bin

# Validate the quote using the trusted public key
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify <trusted public key file> -signature quote.bin pcr_values.bin


```

In the example above, the tpm2_pcrread utility is used to read the values of the PCRs into a file named pcr_values.bin. The tpm2_quote utility is then used to create a quote of the PCR values using the context file named context.bin. The resulting quote is stored in a file named quote.bin. Finally, the openssl command is used to validate the quote using the trusted public key.

It's important to note that the TPM2 chip must be enabled and accessible in order to create a quote of the PCR values. Additionally, you may need to configure the TPM2 chip and set up the IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture) subsystem before you can create a quote of the PCR values.

Please consult the tpm2-tools documentation and the Linux IMA documentation for more information on creating a PCR quote using a trusted public key.
