### Create a trusted public key to perform PCR quote

To create a trusted public key for the purpose of performing a PCR (Platform Configuration Register) quote, you need to first create the key using a public key cryptography algorithm such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Then, the public key must be loaded into the TPM2 chip as a trusted key.

Here's an example of how to create a trusted RSA public key using OpenSSL:

```yaml

# Generate a private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem

# Extract the public key from the private key
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# Load the public key into the TPM2 chip
tpm2_load -c context.bin -u public.pem -r key.rsa -n key.name -f pem

# Make the key a trusted key
tpm2_evictcontrol -C o -c context.bin -S 0x01000000 -P owner -a key.name


```

In this example, the openssl genpkey command is used to generate a private RSA key and store it in a file named private.pem. The openssl rsa command is then used to extract the public key from the private key and store it in a file named public.pem. The tpm2_load command is used to load the public key into the TPM2 chip and store it in a file named key.rsa. Finally, the tpm2_evictcontrol command is used to make the key a trusted key.

It's important to keep the private key secure, as it is used to sign digital signatures and decrypt encrypted messages. The public key, on the other hand, can be used to validate the digital signatures created by the TPM2.

Please consult the tpm2-tools documentation for more information on creating and using a trusted public key for the purpose of performing a PCR quote.
